# Outline

Here we provide 

1. **Videos with molecular dynamics of a BAC molecule integration into a *L. monocytogene* membrane** for different repetitions. It shows that (1) the BAC approaches the cellular membrane, (2) the BAC is adsorbed on its surface, and (3) it is rapidly integrated into the lipid bilayer, where it remains at least for several nanoseconds, probably destabilising the membrane.
2. **MATLAB scripts with the kinetic model and data used to simulate time-kill curves** of *L. monocytogenes* with benzalkonium chloride (BAC), a widely used desinfectant. The model explains and predicts the interplay between disinfectant and pathogen at two different initial microbial densities (inocula) and BAC concentrations (dose). For simulation in matlab of the model, please run in Matlab the file Main_simulate_kinetics.m
